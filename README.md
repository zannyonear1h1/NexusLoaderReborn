# NexusLoaderReborn
A loader for Minecraft Bedrock that will inject/patch Minecraft for Bedrock to remove the free trial data, and unlock the game!

Be aware, you need:
- Windows 10/11
- Minecraft for Bedrock
- .NET Framework 8.0

Your computer may try to detect this a malware, it is not malware, and it ain't ransomware! This software will certainly not infect your computer, it will just unlock Minecraft, malware detections of this type are known as false positives!
It can be bypassed by disabling Windows Defender!

Cheers!
